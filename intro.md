# MyRust.dev - FAQ Guide for Python & C++ Developers

Welcome to **MyRust.dev** - your practical guide to Rust programming.

This site answers the questions every Python and C++ developer has when learning Rust. No fluff. Just practical answers.

## Who is this for?

- Python developers who want to learn systems programming
- C++ developers looking for memory safety without garbage collection
- Software engineers who want direct, simple explanations
- Anyone transitioning from dynamic or manual memory management

## What makes Rust different?

Rust gives you **C++ performance** with **Python-like safety**. It prevents crashes and memory bugs at compile time, without runtime overhead.

Think of it as:
- **Safer than C++**: No segfaults, memory leaks, or data races
- **Faster than Python**: Compiles to native code, no interpreter
- **More productive than both**: Modern tooling, package manager, helpful compiler

## How to use this guide

Each section answers specific questions you have as a Python or C++ developer.

- **Examples compare** Rust code to what you already know
- **No jargon** until concepts are explained with familiar analogies
- **Short answers** focused on practical understanding

Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) and work through the sections that interest you most.
